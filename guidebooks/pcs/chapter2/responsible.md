# Responsible Public Engagement in Data Science and AI
Before we turn to the practical methods and tools in the following chapters, there is a final question to consider:

> What does it mean to conduct *responsible* public engagement in data science and AI?

Responsible research and innovation is increasingly important in science and technology.
As a term, 'responsible research and innovation' (RRI) is most strongly associated with the European Commission's Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development—a set of funding programmes that support research in the European Union.
Beginning with the seventh framework programme in 2010, and continuing on through Horizon 2020 (FP8), the term 'responsible research and innovation' became increasingly important for the European Commission's policy.

Since then, other national funding bodies have also shown a commitment to RRI.
For example, [UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/) have developed the [AREA framework](https://www.ukri.org/about-us/epsrc/our-policies-and-standards/framework-for-responsible-innovation/), which sets out four principles for RRI: Anticipate, Reflect, Engage, and Act (AREA).

:class:important
**Anticipate**
- Describe and analyse the impacts, intended or otherwise, that might arise. Do not seek to predict but rather support the exploration of possible impacts (such as economic, social and environmental) and implications that may otherwise remain uncovered and little discussed.

**Reflect**
- Reflect on the purposes of, motivations for and potential implications of the research, together with the associated uncertainties, areas of ignorance, assumptions, framings, questions, dilemmas and social transformations these may bring.

**Engage**
- Open up such visions, impacts and questioning to broader deliberation, dialogue, engagement and debate in an inclusive way.

**Act**
- Use these processes to influence the direction and trajectory of the research and innovation process itself.

However, research and innovation in data science and AI is unlike traditional scientific research or technological innovation in many ways.
For example, the following considerations are pertinent and relate to the impact upon public engagement specifically:

- Effective public communication requires sufficient levels of data and digital literacy (e.g. understanding of statistics, data visualisation)
- Conceptual knowledge and understanding of relevant concepts such as 'autonomous and adaptive behaviour', 'intelligence', or ' algorithmic system' may vary widely, such that different stakeholders may not be talking about the same thing
- Participants will hold differing opinions on key topics, such as data privacy and protection, which could give rise to challenging attitudes such as *algorithmic aversion*.[^aversion]
- Values and norms concering the impact of novel darta-driven technologies are still in flux, as they continue to affect different areas of society. Therefore, public attitudes may also vary, perhaps drastically, over time.

[^aversion]: Algorithmic aversion refers to the reluctance of human agents to incorporate algorithmic tools as part of their decision-making processes due to misaligned expectations of the algorithm’s performance (see Burton et al. 2020).

As such, legitimate doubts could be raised about how universally these principles apply, and also whether they extend to considerations about public engagement?

In response to these doubts, a justifiable argument could be made that some principles of RRI are more directly relevant to some of the applied sciences than more theoretical disciplines (e.g. fundamental physics).

Two comments can be made:

1. We should exercise caution in assenting to such a belief too rapidly given the many examples in the history of science that show how unintended consequences can arise as a result of advances in some scientific discipline that even experts could not foresee (see [this example](../../rri/chapter2/history.md)).
2. Although principles of RRI may apply more strongly in some areas of application or research, there are also principles (e.g. [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)) that support responsible public engagement that ought to apply universally (e.g. research integrity, promotion of equality, diversity, and inclusivity among researchers).
