## What is the goal of science communication?

There are a couple of ways we can begin answering this question. 

First of all, we may want to be more specific about the scope of the term 'science'. You may think, for example, that the goal of public communication for the medical sciences has a very different goal than that of the astronomocical sciences. 

In this course we will focus on data science and AI. However, before we consider why we may wish to engage and communicate with members of the public as data scientists or AI researchers, it is worth considering what the goal of science communication is in general. 

The second way we could answer the above question, therefore, is in this more general sense. That is, what is the goal, if any, that *all forms* of science communication share? Before you read on, try and answer this question:

What do you think is the goal of science communication?

You may have come up with these answers, or variants of them:

- to inform members of the public of advances in science and technology that could improve their lives in some way
- to provide forms of entertainment for the intellectually curious
- to improve public understanding of science so that all people have the opportunity to contribute to scientific advancements
- to ensure that the public trust scientists and that there is accountability for how publicly-funded science affects society
- to educate members of the public about scientific truths to help combat misinformation or disinformation
- to help members of the public better appreciate the benefits provided by science to society

- Science as a human right (UN)
- Citizen Science
- Four models of public communication:
 - Deficit
 - Contextual
 - Lay expertise
 - Public Participation
- Examples of citizen data science or AI engagement: https://www.nesta.org.uk/toolkit/civicai-urban-forest/ https://smellmycity.org https://www.midata.coop/en/home/ https://colouringlondon.org
 - Are these projects attempts to fill the deficit? 
 - To create public participation in science? 
 - To help people bring local knowledge to solve local problems?
 - Each example may be an example of more than one question. Or, they may exist for alternative reasons.
